##Inspiration
Decentralised Identity is one of the burning topics in today's and tomorrow's world. With new technologies based on Blockchain popping up every day, the wish for a decentralised identity is getting louder and louder. 

Our decentralised platform will try to tackle this need.

“We should strive to make online identity better than paper-based identity across the board. Digitalization should not just be about making a process faster but should also retain important properties of the old process.” - Algorand

##What it does
TODO @team 
Decentralised access and membership management for a community. The use case is not limited to specific university communities but applies to a large user-target group. Our web-based application utilises Algorand’s pure proof-of-stake (ppos) blockchain cryptocurrency protocol, which only requires minimal Hardware, has very low fees (less than 0.0001 Euro), is carbon neutral, and is Post-Quantum secure Blockchain- So you can create a fully decentralised platform.

##How we built it
TODO @team
How? Even we don’t know it… 
Coffee, Mate
Long Discussions

-##Challenges we ran into
TODO @team
Algorand, Algorand, and Algorand. Finding bugs in Algorand… 

##Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Fully functional working decentralised MVP platform with some bugs on top and a chaotic UX. 

##What we learned
Teamwork, staying up late nights, Blockchain-based transactions
